# Create Ad from Landing Page

This project is designed for learning purposes and aims to explore Next.js, a React framework, while building a web application to create advertisements from landing pages.

## Project Overview

The application enables users to generate basic display ads from landing page URLs. Users can preview and download the ad in HTML format, encapsulated within a zip file. This feature facilitates the seamless integration of the generated ads into ad management platforms.

## Usage Instructions

- Input a valid landing page URL into the provided field.
- Click on 'Generate Preview' to initiate the ad creation process.
- Ensure that the landing page contains essential metadata such as title, description, image, and brand information.

## Technology stach

- Next.js: A React framework used for server-side rendering and building optimized web applications.
- Vercel: A cloud platform for deploying Next.js applications with seamless integration and rapid deployment capabilities.
- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

## Development Setup

To begin development, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install project dependencies using `npm install`.
- Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
- Access the application at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
- Begin editing the application by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

This project leverages the next/font plugin to optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font, for enhanced typography.
